I always wanted to get into reading but i never knew where to start. Book recommendation sites only cater to those who already have read manny books and does not satisfy new readers like myself.

As the popularity of movies and TV shows grows, I have developed an application that gives book recommendations by inputting shows and movies.

This was implemented using content-based and collaborative filtering to provide cross-media recommendations.

Developed using Django as backend and Vue.js as frontend
